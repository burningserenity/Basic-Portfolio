        <img id="my_face" src="./assets/images/My_Face.png" alt="Nicholas Carlton" width="200" height="150"> It is my opinion that the Internet is the single greatest human achievement of all time. When I was a young teenager, I had an assignment in high
        school to present facts about manatees. One of the first things I found on the Internet in researching this assignment was an argument that manatees, being too slow to evade boat propellers, are a species unfit for survival and should thus be allowed
        to go extinct. Until then, I thought it unanimous that humans need to preserve endangered species, for the sake of biodiversity. This contrary position, though I don't strictly agree with it, was so logical and so against the attitudes of those
        around me, that I would never again take anyone's values at face value.

        Here is a second paragraph. That Latin stuff is annoying to look at, but
        I guess I will have to get used to it.
