    <p>
      It is my opinion that the Internet is the single greatest human achievement of all time.
      When I was a young teenager, I had an assignment in high school to present facts about manatees.
      One of the first things I found on the Internet in researching this assignment was an argument
      that manatees, being too slow to evade boat propellers, are a species unfit for survival and
      should thus be allowed to go extinct. Until then, I thought it unanimous that humans need to
      preserve endangered species, for the sake of biodiversity. This contrary position, though I
      don't strictly agree with it, was so logical and so against the attitudes of thosearound me,
      that I would never again take anyone's values at face value.
